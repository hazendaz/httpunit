<h1>Introduction</h2>
<p>Automated unit testing is a great way to ensure that code being
maintained works and continues to work. The <A HREF="http://www.XProgramming.com/">Extreme
Programming</A> (XP) methodology relies heavily on it, and practitioners
have available to them a range of <A HREF="http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm">unit
testing frameworks</A>, which work by making direct calls to the
code being tested. But what if you want to test a web application?
HttpUnit is a library which makes this possible.</p>

<p>HttpUnit works by emulating a browser, handling frames, cookies, redirects, and so on. It lets you view pages as
plain text, an XML DOM, or as an aggregation of collection of links, frames, images, and so on.   It lets you select
an element which should lead to a new page and follow it, so that you can easily handle a chain of web pages.</p>

<h2>Test Design and Abstraction</h2>
<p>Unlike most commercial tools, HttpUnit does not rely on record and playback. Its API lets you define what you
want to see or change, even before the web site is built. This is essential for test-first development.
Since the primary use of HttpUnit is to write functional tests, it helps you abstract those elements which are
most likely to change. For example, a page might start by providing a small number of options, using a set of radio buttons:</p>
<form class="sample">
Select the desired color: <input type="radio" name="color" value="red">Red
<input type="radio" name="color" value="green" checked>Green
<input type="radio" name="color" value="blue">Blue
</form>
<p>As the site evolves, the number of options might grow until the UI designer feels that a pull-down menu would be easier
to use to send the same values:</p>
<form class="sample">
Select the desired color: <select name="color">
  <option value="red">Red
  <option value="green" selected>Green
  <option value="blue">Blue
  <option value="yellow">Yellow
  <option value="magenta">Magenta
</select>
</form>
<p>Further expansion could lead to a free-form textual input:</p>
<form class="sample">
  Enter the desired color: <input type="text" name="color" value="green">
</form>
<p>A tool which focuses on the type of control actually
on the page would force the testers to rewrite their tests with each change, even though the functionality of the site
is unchanged. HttpUnit focuses on the intent of the entry, and allows tests to be defined in terms of the values to
be transmitted. It is aware of the controls being used and ensures that only values which a user could supply will be
sent; however, the tester need only focus on the desired value for each test.</p>
