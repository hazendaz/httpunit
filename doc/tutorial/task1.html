<h1>Creating the Pool Editor</h1>
<p>Our initial task will be the creation of the simple pool editor, following use case 1.1. To restrict access to the
administrator, we will take advantage of declarative security defined by the Servlet standard. As part of this task, we will
use the Basic Authentication approach, which causes the browser to pop up a challenge dialog. The more common form-based
authentication is handled the same way that all forms should be.</p>
<p>
To begin the tutorial, create a working directory and expand <a href="task1.zip">this archive</a> into it.  To run the
tutorial, you will need httpunit.jar, junit.jar, servlet.jar, nekohtml.jar, xercesImpl.jar, and xmlParserAPIs.jar
(all included in the HttpUnit download) on your classpath. If you use
<code>ant</code>, you can either copy
them into the <code>jars</code> directory just created, or invoke ant with <code>-Dclasspath="..."</code>, specifying the locations
of those jars between the quotation marks. If you do not use <code>ant</code>, note that the main class is named
<code>tutorial.PoolEditorTest</code><p>

<p>You will write your code in the src/tutorial sub-directory.</p>

<p>Once you are ready, proceed to <a href="task1editor-initial.html">step one</a> to begin the tutorial.</p>
