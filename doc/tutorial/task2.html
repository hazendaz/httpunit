<h1>Controlling access to the application</h1>
<p>At this point, we have a working pool editor, accessible only to a user with the appropriate assigned role. Any other
user will be refused when they try to access the editor. We would like to go further, and provide a common front page
to the application for all users, which will provide links to the permitted pages only.</p>

<!--
To begin the tutorial, create a working directory and expand <a href="task2.zip">this archive</a> into it.
Either create a jars directory and copy httpunit.jar, Tidy.jar, and xerces.jar into it, or make sure that they are on
your classpath and invoke ant passing the classpath as a property.
You will write your code in the src/tutorial sub-directory.

Once you are ready, proceed to <a href="task2access-authentication.html">step one</a> to begin the tutorial. -->
