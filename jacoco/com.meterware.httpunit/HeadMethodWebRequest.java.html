/**
 * A web request using the HEAD method. This request is used to obtain header information for a resource without
 * necessarily waiting for the data to be computed or transmitted. RFC 2616
 * http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html defines: 9.4 HEAD The HEAD method is identical to GET except
 * that the server MUST NOT return a message-body in the response. The metainformation contained in the HTTP headers in
 * response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical to the information sent in response to a GET request. This method can
 * be used for obtaining metainformation about the entity implied by the request without transferring the entity-body
 * itself. This method is often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.
 * The response to a HEAD request MAY be cacheable in the sense that the information contained in the response MAY be
 * used to update a previously cached entity from that resource. If the new field values indicate that the cached entity
 * differs from the current entity (as would be indicated by a change in Content-Length, Content-MD5, ETag or
 * Last-Modified), then the cache MUST treat the cache entry as stale.
