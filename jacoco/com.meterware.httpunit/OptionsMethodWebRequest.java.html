/**
 * A {@link WebRequest} using the OPTIONS method.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * RFC 2616 section 9.2 defines:
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the communication options available on the
 * request/response chain identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to determine the options and/or
 * requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action or
 * initiating a resource retrieval.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Responses to this method are not cacheable.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If the OPTIONS request includes an entity-body (as indicated by the presence of Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding),
 * then the media type MUST be indicated by a Content-Type field. Although this specification does not define any use
 * for such a body, future extensions to HTTP might use the OPTIONS body to make more detailed queries on the server. A
 * server that does not support such an extension MAY discard the request body.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If the Request-URI is an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;), the OPTIONS request is intended to apply to the server in general rather
 * than to a specific resource. Since a server's communication options typically depend on the resource, the &quot;*&quot; request
 * is only useful as a &quot;ping&quot; or &quot;no-op&quot; type of method; it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test the
 * capabilities of the server. For example, this can be used to test a proxy for HTTP/1.1 compliance (or lack thereof).
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If the Request-URI is not an asterisk, the OPTIONS request applies only to the options that are available when
 * communicating with that resource.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A 200 response SHOULD include any header fields that indicate optional features implemented by the server and
 * applicable to that resource (e.g., Allow), possibly including extensions not defined by this specification. The
 * response body, if any, SHOULD also include information about the communication options. The format for such a
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * body is not defined by this specification, but might be defined by future extensions to HTTP. Content negotiation MAY
 * be used to select the appropriate response format. If no response body is included, the response MUST include a
 * Content-Length field with a field-value of &quot;0&quot;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The Max-Forwards request-header field MAY be used to target a specific proxy in the request chain. When a proxy
 * receives an OPTIONS request on an absoluteURI for which request forwarding is permitted, the proxy MUST check for a
 * Max-Forwards field. If the Max-Forwards field-value is zero (&quot;0&quot;), the proxy MUST NOT forward the message; instead,
 * the proxy SHOULD respond with its own communication options. If the Max-Forwards field-value is an integer greater
 * than zero, the proxy MUST decrement the field-value when it forwards the request. If no Max-Forwards field is present
 * in the request, then the forwarded request MUST NOT include a Max-Forwards field.
 *
 * @see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html&quot;&gt;RFC-2616 Section 9&lt;/a&gt;
