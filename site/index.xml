<p>The normal way to access web sites is via a browser; however, there are times when it is desirable to
bypass the browser and access a site from a program, including:
<ul><li><ref page="automated-testing">automated web site testing</ref></li>
<li>using a web-site as part of a distributed application</li></ul>

HttpUnit makes this easy. Written in Java,
HttpUnit emulates the relevant portions of browser behavior, including
form submission, <ref page="Javascript-support">JavaScript</ref>,
basic <a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2617.txt">http authentication</a>,
cookies and automatic page redirection, and allows
Java test code to examine returned pages either as text, an XML DOM, or containers of forms, tables, and links.</p>
<p>
A companion framework, <ref page="servletunit-intro">ServletUnit</ref> is included in the download.

<section title="What is it?">
<p><strong>HttpUnit</strong> is a free, <ref page="license">open source</ref> Java API for accessing web sites without a browser,
and is ideally suited for automated unit testing of web sites when combined with a
Java unit test framework such as <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>.
It was designed and implemented by <developer>Russell Gold.</developer></p>
