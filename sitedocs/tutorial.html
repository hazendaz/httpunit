<title>HttpUnit Tutorial - intro</title>

<body>
<p>This tutorial should help you to learn to use HttpUnit to develop and test your web sites. It will take you through the incremental
development of a simple servlet-based web application using a test-first approach. That is, first you are encouraged to
write and execute a test for the next piece of functionality to be added, verify that the test fails (demonstrating that
the functionality is not in place), and then implement the functionality and verify that the test now passes.</p>

<p>The initial tasks will use the <code>ServletRunner</code> class, thus bypassing the need for a web browser or servlet
engine. Later tasks will require a web browser and a servlet engine, and use <code>WebConversation</code>.</p>

<h2>The Application</h2>

<p>Our application is an office sport betting pool. An administrator is designated to manage the pool, which includes
opening and closing the betting. Entrants select the winner in each of the up to 10 games defined by the administrator
and also guess the total score in one of those games, as designated by the administrator. The winner of the pool is the
one who got the most winners correct, with any ties going to the person whose predicted total score in the tie-breaker game
was closest to the actual final score.</p>

<p>We will identify the following uses of the system:</p>

<dl class="story-list"><dt>1.1 Administrator Opens Pool</dt>
<dd>The administrator defines up to ten games, specifying the home and away team for each game. He also selects one of
these games as the tie-breaker. Once the data is correct, the administrator opens the pool for betting.</dd>

<dt>1.2 Administrator Closes Pool</dt>
<dd>After the pool is open, the administrator may at any time close the pool, thus preventing any
further bets or changes to existing bets.</dd>

<dt>1.3 Administrator Posts Results</dt>
<dd>After the pool is closed, the administrator enters actual scores for each of the games played.
Once all scores have been entered, the administrator posts the results.</dd>

<dt>2.1 Users enters a bet</dt>
<dd>After the pool is open, a user may sign on and create a bet, predicting the winner of each game
and the total score of the tie-breaker game. The user may change his bet until the pool is closed.</dd>

<dt>2.2 User views results</dt>
<dd>Once the results have been posted, a user may examine his own bet to see how well he did. The
system will indicate the correct predictions and the user's rank in the pool.</dd>

<dt>2.3 User views standings</dt>
<dd>Once the results have been posted, a user may view a list of all bidders ranked by number of
correct predictions.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This application is fairly simple, and hardly robust, but contains more than enough interactions to allow us to
explore development and testing with HttpUnit.

<h2>Tutorial Organization</h2>

<p>Each section of the tutorial will address a specific use of the system, and show how HttpUnit and ServletUnit can be used
to write tests which verify that functionality. You should begin each section by copying the initial directory, which includes
an ant build script and some classes that you will need to complete it.  Running the ant script will compile the code and
run the tests. If you are not using ant, compile and run tutorial.TutorialTestSuite. After you implement each test,
it should fail until you then add the implementation.</p>
