<p>Automated testing is a great way to ensure that code being maintained works.
The <A HREF="http://www.XProgramming.com/">Extreme Programming</A> (XP) methodology relies heavily on it,
and practitioners have available to them a range of
<A HREF="http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm">testing frameworks</A>,
most of which work by making direct calls to the code being tested.
But what if you want to test a web application?
Or what if you simply want to use a web-site as part of a distributed application?</p>

<p>In either case, you need to be able to bypass the browser and access your site from a program.
HttpUnit makes this easy. Written in Java,
HttpUnit emulates the relevant portions of browser behavior, including
form submission, <a href="doc/javascript-support.html">JavaScript</a>,
basic <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2617.txt">http authentication</A>,
cookies and automatic page redirection, and allows
Java test code to examine returned pages either as text, an XML DOM, or containers of forms, tables, and links. When
combined with a framework such as <A HREF="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>, it is fairly easy to write tests that very
quickly verify the functioning of a web site.</p>

<p>The same techniques used to test web sites can be used to test and develop servlets without a servlet container
using <A HREF="doc/servletunit-intro.html">ServletUnit</A>, included in the download.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
Several working example files come with the distribution download.
A rudimentary <A HREF="doc/cookbook.html">Cookbook</A> is available, as are
a <a href="doc/tutorial/index.html">tutorial</a>, a <A HREF="doc/faq.html">FAQ</A> and
the <A HREF="doc/api/index.html">javadoc</A>.
Work has also begun on a <a href="doc/manual/index.html">User's Manual</a>
