/**
 * An HTTP request using the GET method. RFC 2616 http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html defines: 9.3 GET
 * The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If
 * the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in
 * the response and not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process. The
 * semantics of the GET method change to a "conditional GET" if the request message includes an If-Modified-Since,
 * If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field. A conditional GET method requests that the
 * entity be transferred only under the circumstances described by the conditional header field(s). The conditional GET
 * method is intended to reduce unnecessary network usage by allowing cached entities to be refreshed without requiring
 * multiple requests or transferring data already held by the client. The semantics of the GET method change to a
 * "partial GET" if the request message includes a Range header field. A partial GET requests that only part of the
 * entity be transferred, as described in section 14.35. The partial GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary
 * network usage by allowing partially-retrieved entities to be completed without transferring data already held by the
 * client. The response to a GET request is cacheable if and only if it meets the requirements for HTTP caching
 * described in section 13. See section 15.1.3 for security considerations when used for forms.
