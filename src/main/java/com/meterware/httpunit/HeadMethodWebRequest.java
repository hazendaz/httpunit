/**
 * A web request using the HEAD method. This request is used to obtain header
 * information for a resource without necessarily waiting for the data to be
 * computed or transmitted.
 *
 * RFC 2616 http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html defines:
 * 9.4 HEAD
 *
 * The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a
 * message-body in the response. The metainformation contained in the HTTP
 * headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical to the information
 * sent in response to a GET request. This method can be used for obtaining
 * metainformation about the entity implied by the request without transferring
 * the entity-body itself. This method is often used for testing hypertext links
 * for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.
 *
 * The response to a HEAD request MAY be cacheable in the sense that the
 * information contained in the response MAY be used to update a previously
 * cached entity from that resource. If the new field values indicate that the
 * cached entity differs from the current entity (as would be indicated by a
 * change in Content-Length, Content-MD5, ETag or Last-Modified), then the cache
 * MUST treat the cache entry as stale.
