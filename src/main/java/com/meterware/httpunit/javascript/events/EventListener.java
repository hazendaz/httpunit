 * The EventListener interface is the primary method for handling events. Users implement the EventListener interface

 * EventListener from its EventTarget after they have completed using the listener. When a Node is copied using the
 * cloneNode method the EventListeners attached to the source Node are not attached to the copied Node. If the user
 * wishes the same EventListeners to be added to the newly created copy the user must add them manually.
