<p>Classes to control HTML parsing. The primary access to this package is through
{@link com.meterware.httpunit.parsing.HTMLParserFactory}, which allows a user to select the HTML parser that will be used
to parse HTML pages returned by a {@link com.meterware.httpunit.WebClient}.  In addition to selecting the actual class,
the factory also permits various options to be set on whichever parser is chosen - with the caveat that not every
parser supports every property. If the current parser does not in fact support a property, setting it on the factory
will have no effect.
