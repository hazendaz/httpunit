        Classes for unit testing servlets, providing internal access to running servlets using a simulated servlet container. Each test session should begin by creating a {@link com.meterware.servletunit.ServletRunner ServletRunner} which will act as a servlet application context. The definition of application context may be supplied in one of two ways. The {@link com.meterware.servletunit.ServletRunner#registerServlet(String,String) registerServlet} method allows the association of a servlet with a url path. Alternately, an entire servlet application may be defined by passing the name of the desired web.xml file. The {@link com.meterware.servletunit.ServletRunner#newClient newClient} method will return a {@link com.meterware.servletunit.ServletUnitClient ServletUnitClient} object which can be used to invoke the defined servlets, just as any subclass of {@link com.meterware.httpunit.WebClient WebClient}. In addition, this client object defines methods which allow access to the fully initializated servlet itself, as well as the request, response, and servlet session. A
